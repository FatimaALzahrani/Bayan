## Project Overview

Bayan is a groundbreaking mobile banking application meticulously designed to bridge the accessibility gap for individuals with hearing and visual impairments. Traditional banking applications often present significant challenges due to their reliance on visual and auditory interactions that may not cater to the diverse needs of these communities. Bayan addresses this critical issue by offering an innovative, inclusive, and secure platform that leverages advanced voice and visual technologies to enable complete financial independence.

## The Core Mission

Our primary objective with Bayan is to empower users with hearing and visual impairments to manage their finances with unparalleled autonomy. This is achieved through a sophisticated system that transforms textual content into spoken language and visually represents it via sign language using a dynamic, virtual 3D avatar. This adaptive and empathetic approach ensures a tailored user experience that respects and accommodates their unique capabilities, rather than making assumptions about them.
